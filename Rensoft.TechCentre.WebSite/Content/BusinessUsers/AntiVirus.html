<h1>Anti-Virus</h1>
<p>Anti-Virus plays a large part in protecting your systems from unwanted problems and system downtime. A recent calculation performed at TechCentre showed that 2 computers infected with viruses, would cost more in down time and repairs than for one of our Engineers to fit and supply an Anti-Virus program for a 5 user system.</p>
<p>Anti-Virus now comes with additional benefits like Anti-Spyware (pop-up blocking, etc), increased security firewalls, and device control (to stop people using CD Recorders or USB Memory sticks).</p>
