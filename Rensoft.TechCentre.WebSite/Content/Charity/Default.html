<h1>TechCentre Charity Events</h1>

<p>Last summer, the TechCentre staff took part in a number of fundraising 
events. Firstly, the Royal Agricultural shows where TechCentre raised money 
through a Mouse throwing competition. </p>
<p>The competition was won by Abbie Williams who took away a new laptop.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The staff also undertook a sponsored weight loss, in which the team 
collectively lost weight. After this successful campaign and the success of the 
Royal Shows we managed to raise £1200. The money was split equally between our 
two chosen charities, Manx Cancer Help and Robert Owen House. This was donated 
at our Client Christmas Party which took place in Bar George. <o:p></o:p>

<p>This summer we will once again be taking part in the Royal Agricultural Show 
on 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> August. The ever popular Mouse throwing 
competition will be making a comeback along with other fun filled games and 
activities.

This year we will be supporting a very worthy cause, the Friends of Chernobyl’s 
Children. The charity&#39;s aim is to relieve the suffering of children affected by 
the radiation explosion from the nuclear plant at Chernobyl.</p>

<p>All the staff at TechCentre would like to extend their thanks to everyone who 
took part in and supported our fundraising efforts. Without your support we 
would not have been able to achieve such a grand total. We hope that you will 
continue to support us throughout the upcoming year as we attempt to raise money 
for charity!</p>
