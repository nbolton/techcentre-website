<p>Tom joined the company as Sales & Marketing Co-ordinator, after completing a Business Studies degree at University.

His determination to succeed and undoubted professionalism will see him thrive and ensure his successful future at the company.</p>
<p>Like his brother, Tom has been on the Isle of Man for over 17 years, having moved over from Manchester. After completing the International Baccalaureate at King William’s College, he returned to Manchester to attend University.</p>
<p>Tom is a Formula 1 fan, and this stems from his interest in fast and exotic cars. However, when he is not dreaming about which car he wishes he could have, he enjoys travelling, rugby and relaxing with friends.</p>
