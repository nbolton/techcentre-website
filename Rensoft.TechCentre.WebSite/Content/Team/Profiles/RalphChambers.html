It is during this time that he gained his experience in the IT field ranging from Cisco products to printers and server support.</p>
<p>Ralph has recently taken the leap and moved to the Island with his fiancee and their new baby. In his spare time he is taking advantage of all the island has to offer by joining an adventure centre where he enjoys sea kayaking, coast steering and all the wonderful walks on the island.</p>
